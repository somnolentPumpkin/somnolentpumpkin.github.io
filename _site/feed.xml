This is my first blog post on the new wricken.com. It’s powered by Jekyll, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>I set this up because my old host for wricken.com became too expensive, and didn’t get enough use to justify paying the monthly fee.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to get back into writing for a while, so I’m excited to write some stuff that I’ll post here.</p>

<p>I also need a portfolio, so this website will be used for that as well, once I get around to setting that up.</p>

<p>Cheers to a new start!</p>
