description: A game prototype where you fly a broomstick, and hit balls with it.

This is a game prototype I made during the early stages of the Covid pandemic, while everyone was learning to make sourdough. The premise is that you're flying a broomstick, and you hit balls with it.

I didn't end up deciding to turn it into a full game, but the prototype itself was enormously fun to play, and I sank a lot of time into hitting balls into the air, then trying to hit them again before they went off the map.

I was pretty early into learning Unreal Engine back then, and this project helped me become comfortable with it.
