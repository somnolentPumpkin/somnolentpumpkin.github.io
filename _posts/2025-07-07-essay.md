Hello! This is my first blog post on the new wricken.com. It's powered by Jekyll, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

I set this up because my old host for wricken.com became too expensive, and didn't get enough use to justify paying the monthly fee.

I've been wanting to get back into writing for a while, so I'm excited to write some stuff that I'll post here.

I also need a portfolio, so this website will be used for that as well, once I get around to setting that up.

Cheers to a new start!
